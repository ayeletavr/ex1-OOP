In this exercise, we were requested to implement each class exactly according to its API.

=  Implementation details   =
=============================
In addition to the methods in the API, I added one another method in the Library class,
that is called currentlyBorrowing, which counts for a specific patron's Id how many books is he currently borrowing.
Of course I used this method only inside the class - it's private since it's not a part of the API.
